# The Weft

The Weft is a techno-empathic ability that lets an individual sense and influence networked systems, chipped minds, and Convergence-corrupted organisms. Wren's Weft is unique in strength and sensitivity, allowing them to perceive overlays of memory and control certain emergent systems inside Arbour.

Key notes:
- Sensory reach: localized to ship/Arbour systems and connected chips.
- Effects: can modulate systems, calm or stir chipped minds, and alter minor Convergence behavior.
