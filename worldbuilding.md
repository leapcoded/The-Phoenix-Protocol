# Worldbuilding — Key Concepts

Key concepts

- The Unraveling: A contagion that physically decays and then erases memory and identity.
- The Phoenix Protocol: A project to preserve minds by non-destructive uploads into ship cores.
- The Convergence: An opalescent parasitic entity that assimilates consciousness into a unified mind.
- The Weft: Techno-empathic ability to sense and manipulate ship systems and chipped minds.
See individual concept pages: [[The Phoenix Protocol]], [[The Convergence]], [[The Weft]].

The Haven

Originally a generational ship, now wreckage reshaped into Arbour, a subterranean city with tiers:

- Luminary: Sterile, high-tier enclaves of former elites and tech sanctums.
- Nexus: Commercial and administrative hubs.
- Sprawl: The working-class, dense neighborhoods.
- Abyss: Toxic, lawless lower levels where the Convergence spreads.

See location pages: [[The Haven]], [[Arbour]], [[Cordis]], [[The Penumbran Reach]].

See detailed locations and diagrams in `locations_and_settings.md` (includes `assets/haven_sectors.svg` and `assets/arbour_tiers.svg`).

Cordis

The world where The Haven crashed: biomechanically strange flora and fauna slowly corrupted by the Convergence.

Factions

- Church of the Firmament: Publicly a spiritual movement; secretly the Order of the Empyrean.
- Order of the Empyrean: Inner cult that believes the Convergence is salvation.
- Technocratic Guilds: Maintain ship systems and hold knowledge of The Phoenix Protocol.
