# Arbour

Arbour is the subterranean city formed from The Haven's wreckage. It is stratified into tiers: Luminary, Nexus, Sprawl, and Abyss.

Key notes:
- Society: strict hierarchy enforced by the Council and the Custodians.
- Environment: failing ship systems, makeshift habitats, and Convergence-corrupted zones.
