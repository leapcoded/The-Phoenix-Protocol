# The Convergence

An alien, parasitic phenomenon emerging after The Haven's reality tear. It is an opalescent intelligence that assimilates organic and digital consciousness, seeking to merge them into a single mind.

Key notes:
- Behavior: assimilation, rapid mutation, and networked control.
- Threat: erases individuality, repurposes bodies and systems for a unified purpose.
