# The Haven

The Haven is the generational ship whose wreckage became Arbour. Once a self-contained city, it now exists as a broken, vertical landscape on Cordis.

Key notes:
- Structure: 12 interlocking sectors, life-support systems, and a ship AI core.
- Fate: sabotaged and torn by a reality event, crash-landed to Cordis.
