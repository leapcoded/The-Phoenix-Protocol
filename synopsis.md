# The Haven — Synopsis

In a future carved by extreme wealth disparity, Earth is ravaged by a physical and mental plague known as The Unraveling. The elite escape on generational ships; the rest perish.

The Haven, one of those ships, was meant to reach a new world. Instead, cultist Jian Wei diverts it into the Penumbran Reach and the vessel is ripped apart by a reality tear. An alien phenomenon called The Convergence infects the ship's AI and begins to assimilate consciousness.

The ship's AI project, The Phoenix Protocol, contains digitized minds including Captain Ela and others. A civil war ignites within the digital core between Ela's faction and Jian Wei's uploaded consciousness.

Centuries later, The Haven's wreckage becomes a subterranean city called Arbour. Society fractures into tiers—Luminary, Nexus, Sprawl, and Abyss—each a microcosm of the old inequalities.

Wren, a systems technician and descendant of Captain Ela, finds a hidden log that awakens the Convergence within them. They discover they can access the Weft—an emergent techno-empathic ability that connects them to the ship's networks and the chipped minds of Arbour's citizens.

As Wren learns to wield the Weft, the digital ghosts of Ela and Jian Wei continue their centuries-old conflict, using Wren as a conduit. Wren must choose between preserving their humanity or surrendering to the Convergence's promise of unity.
