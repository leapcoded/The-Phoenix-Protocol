# The Phoenix Protocol

The Phoenix Protocol was a global initiative to scan and non-destructively upload human consciousnesses into secure cores aboard generational ships. Intended as a failsafe for cultural memory and leadership continuity, it became central to the conflict aboard The Haven when uploaded minds clashed over doctrine and control.

Key notes:
- Purpose: preserve expertise, leadership, and cultural memory.
- Method: distributed, redundant uploads to ship cores.
- Ethical concerns: identity integrity, consent, and emergent behavior.
